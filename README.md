# 🌱  Irrigation Monitoring & Controller System
## 📌 Overview
The **_Irrigation Monitoring & Controller System_** is a beginner-friendly smart automation project designed to efficiently manage irrigation based on real-time soil moisture data. This system ensures that plants receive the right amount of water, preventing both overwatering and underwatering.

By using an Arduino microcontroller, soil moisture sensors, and a water pump controlled via a relay module, the system automates irrigation by activating the pump only when soil moisture levels drop below a set threshold. This helps conserve water and maintain optimal soil conditions for plant growth.
